# Intuition
The problem revolves around determining if a valid original array can exist such that the XOR-derived array matches the given input. The key observation is:

* A derived array is valid if and only if the XOR of all elements in the derived array is zero. This is because XOR is reversible and associative.

# Approach
1) Iterate through all elements of the derived array.
2) Compute the XOR of all elements in the array.
3) If the final result is 0, return true (a valid array can exist); otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesValidArrayExist(vector<int>& derived) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int it:derived){
            ans ^= it;
        }
        return ans==0;
    }
};
```
