# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The intitution is for every even frequency of characters we will have 2 characters left and for odd frequency of characters we eill have only one left.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The approach involves maintaining a frequency vector (count) to store the frequencies of all characters in the string. After calculating the frequencies:

Initialize a variable ans to 0.
Traverse the count array:
If the frequency of a character is odd, add 1 to ans.
If the frequency is even, add 2 to ans.
Finally, return the value of ans as the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)

- Space complexity: O(n)

# Code
```cpp []
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLength(string s) {
        vector<int> count(26,0);
        for(char c:s){
            count[c-'a']++;
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
            if(count[i]==0) continue;
            if(count[i]%2!=0) ans+=1;
            else ans+=2;
        }
        return ans;
        
    }
};
```
